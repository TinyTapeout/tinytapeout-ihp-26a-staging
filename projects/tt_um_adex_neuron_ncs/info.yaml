  author:       "Chenxi Wen"      # Your name
  discord:      ""      # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire Neuron made using DPI circuits in subthreshold regime"      # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Analog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 200x150 uM.
  tiles: "2x2"          # Valid values for analog projects: 1x2, 2x2

  # How many analog pins does your project use?
  analog_pins: 5        # Valid values: 0 to 6

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_adex_neuron_ncs"
