## How it works

A procedural maze is generated on the fly, the generation is 'animated'.
Then a player can control the green dot via a gamepad, additionally two simple solvers (right-hand and left-hand follower) can be started by pressing the 'A' button.
The solvers movement speed can be adjusted using the 'L' and 'R' buttons.
Using the 'SELECT' button a new maze can be generated.

## How to test

Play the game!

## External hardware

A PMOD gamepad and VGA are required.
