## How it works

The adder is a 4-bit ripple carry added, where 4 1-bit full adders are connected. The output result is 4-bits in binary and the carry of the calulation.

## How to test

In the switches select both 4-bit numbers, where the first 4 switches are for the first number and the last 4 are for the second number. 

## External hardware

None.
