  ui[0]: "Connects to an and gate that checks if input 1 is not active and then switches on output pins for digit '1'. Also connects to a not gate for checking if input 1 is active and thus stops displaying a number."
  ui[1]: "Connects to an and gate that checks if input 0 is not active and then switches on output pins for digit '2'. Also connects to a not gate for checking if input 0 is active and thus stops displaying a number."
